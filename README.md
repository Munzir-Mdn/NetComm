# NetComm – Network Communication Study Modules

NetComm is a structured academic portfolio repository containing HTML-based study modules for the subject of Network Communication and Computer Networking fundamentals. This project is designed as a self-learning and reference resource that integrates theoretical explanations with practical lab-oriented content, presented in a clean, browser-accessible format.

The complete module set is accessible through a live web interface hosted via GitHub Pages, allowing users to explore the content without cloning the repository or setting up a local environment.

🌐 Live Website: https://munzir-mdn.github.io/NetComm/

The repository consolidates multiple learning modules covering core networking layers and concepts, including the Application Layer, Transport Layer, Network Layer (Control Plane and Data Plane), and Link Layer. Each module is developed as a standalone HTML document, allowing users to navigate and study the content without requiring additional frameworks or runtime environments. A central index page is provided to enable systematic navigation across all modules.

This project reflects a structured approach to learning network communication, emphasizing conceptual clarity, modular organization, and accessibility. It is suitable for undergraduate students in Computer Science, Network Engineering, and Cyber Security, as well as for educators seeking lightweight teaching materials or revision notes.

## Project Structure
