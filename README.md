# NetComm – Network Communication Study Modules

NetComm is a structured academic portfolio repository containing HTML-based study modules for the subject of Network Communication and Computer Networking fundamentals. This project is designed as a self-learning and reference resource that integrates theoretical explanations with practical lab-oriented content, presented in a clean, browser-accessible format.

The repository consolidates multiple learning modules covering core networking layers and concepts, including the Application Layer, Transport Layer, Network Layer (Control Plane and Data Plane), and Link Layer. Each module is developed as a standalone HTML document, allowing users to navigate and study the content without requiring additional frameworks or runtime environments. A central index page is provided to enable systematic navigation across all modules.

This project reflects a structured approach to learning network communication, emphasizing conceptual clarity, modular organization, and accessibility. It is suitable for undergraduate students in Computer Science, Network Engineering, and Cyber Security, as well as for educators seeking lightweight teaching materials or revision notes.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` – Main navigation page linking all study modules  
- `Module1–Module6.html` – Core networking theory modules  
- `LAB*.html` – Practical lab exercises supporting theoretical concepts  

## Learning Outcomes

Through this repository, learners are able to:
- Understand fundamental principles of computer networking and protocol layering  
- Relate theoretical concepts to practical networking scenarios  
- Navigate and organize technical documentation using modular HTML design  
- Reinforce learning through guided lab-based exercises  

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 for content structure and presentation  
- Browser-based navigation without external dependencies  

## Usage

Clone the repository and open `index.html` using any modern web browser. All modules are fully client-side and require no server configuration.

## Purpose and Scope

This repository is developed as part of an academic learning journey and portfolio documentation. It demonstrates disciplined self-study, technical documentation skills, and foundational knowledge in network communication. The content is intended for educational use and continuous improvement.

## Contributions

Contributions, corrections, or enhancements that improve clarity, accuracy, or structure are welcome through pull requests.
